## ‚ú® Features

### Core Verification System

### üîß Document 404 Error Fix

#### Problem Solved
The system now automatically resolves "Document proxy error: Error: Failed to fetch file: 404" issues that occur when document URLs become inaccessible. **This was a key driver for migrating to UploadThing v7.**

#### Root Causes Addressed
1. **Filename Mismatch**: UploadThing sometimes modifies filenames during upload
2. **Missing URL Storage**: Legacy documents uploaded before URL storage implementation  
3. **File Deletion**: Documents removed from UploadThing storage

#### Solution Features
- **Automatic Detection**: Scans all documents and identifies broken URLs
- **Auto-Fix Capability**: Updates database with working URLs when possible
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Shows which documents are missing vs. fixed
- **Admin Tools**: One-click verification and repair system

#### Document Verifier Tool
The admin panel now includes a **Document Verifier** tool that:

1. **Verifies All Documents**: Tests accessibility of every uploaded document
2. **Auto-Fixes URLs**: Updates database with correct URLs when found
3. **Reports Missing Files**: Lists documents that need user re-upload
4. **Visual Dashboard**: Shows verification status with clear metrics

**How to Use:**
1. Go to Admin Panel ‚Üí Verification Management
2. Click on "Document Tools" tab
3. Click "Verify All Documents"
4. Review results and take action on missing documents

#### API Endpoints for 404 Resolution

**Document Verification API:**
```bash
# Verify all documents (Admin only)
POST /api/admin/documents/verify

# Check specific user's document
GET /api/admin/documents/verify?userId=USER_ID
```

**Document Proxy API:**
```bash
# Access document through CORS-friendly proxy  
GET /api/documents/proxy?url=ENCODED_UPLOADTHING_URL
```

#### Prevention Measures
- **Enhanced Upload Process**: Stores both filename and full URL
- **Upload Validation**: Verifies file accessibility after upload
- **Better Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when files are missing
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed error tracking for debugging

### User Experience Enhancements
- **Smart Status Management**: Clear indication of verification progress
- **Helpful Error Messages**: Actionable guidance when documents fail to load
- **Resubmission Notices**: Clear instructions for users who need to re-upload
